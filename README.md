## Testing

## Wave Tests

* I used Wave for accessibility testing across all pages, to ensure the site has good accessibility. During testing, there were no errors found.

* All pages had an alert due to both the home button and the page icon linking to index.html.However, I wanted to keep both for visitor convenience when the nav bar is collapsed in phone size.

## Results
#### Index Wave Results
![index wave](./assets/images/wave-results/index-wave.png)

* The index page had contrast errors on the 'previous' & 'next' buttons on the carousel. I changed the icons and its colour to be high contrast numerous times, but contrast errors still persisted.

## W3C Code Validation

I used W3C code validator for checking all HTML code is valid. I pasted each pages code into the validatior individually for most accurate validation.

## Results
#### index.html
![index.html](./assets/images/w3c-Validation/indexHtml%20validation.png)

#### walks.html
![walks.html](./assets/images/w3c-Validation/walksHtmlValidation.png)

#### aboutUs.html

#### success.html
![success.html](./assets/images/w3c-Validation/successHtmlValidation.png)

#### style.css
![style.css](./assets/images/w3c-Validation/cssValidation.png)

Satisfied with the result of no errors accross all pages individually, I then tested the HTMl and CSS with URL testing method.

#### URL test HTML
![URL HTML](./assets/images/w3c-Validation/urlHtmlValidation.png)

#### URL test CSS
![URL CSS](./assets/images/w3c-Validation/urlCssValidation.png)

Both tests yielded no errors.

## Light house testing for performance scores

I used Lighthouse testing for performance tests, checking that the site runs smoothly on both desktop and mobile. As expected, mobile results are slightly lower.

When putting each page through testing, tests showed that the images were originally oversized, causing unnecessary load times. As a result, I resized every image on the website for better optimisation, as well as changed their format to .webp.
