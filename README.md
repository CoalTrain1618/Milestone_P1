The Men of Wales website is the central function of the Men of Wales grassroots charity. This charity aims to improve the mental health and wellbeing of men across South Wales by facilitating group walks for new and current service users. The website features current group walks for visitors to view and book, and also offers direction to other services that can help with mental health.

#### Navbar

![navbar-expanded](/assets/images/website-features/nav-bar-feature.png)

#### Footer

![footer](/assets/images/website-features/footer.png)

The footer design is simple and concise, allowing users to navigate to the charity’s social media, copyright information, and a home link to return to the main page. The footer is pushed to the bottom using the website’s flex column design, with a flex 1 property on the {main} element to ensure it takes growth priority.
